# GachaProject
A browser based gacha system that rewards you with cool (and funny) characters and equipment simply just by browsing the interwebs!

# Introduction
I am very fond of the gacha system and I really like how the concept plays on the psychology of the human mind. Getting something out of a percentage chance gives someone the thrill of anticipation, making you (the player) hope for something worth your while. It is very much like gambling, but you can tweak the values to reward everyone who takes a chance (even though it's not as valuable as the top prize). The system is widely used on a lot of mobile games namely Fire Emblem Heroes and Brave Frontier, but sometimes you just want the system, not the gameplay.

# The Project
This project will be based solely on the gacha system itself, stripping everything around it such as the gameplay. The system will be the core of this project, focusing more on the probability algorithms (more on that later), and the inclusion of the actual items themselves, ranging from characters with deep lore to weapons that you can equip them with. The currency, or currency generation, will be linked to a home-brew browser extension that uses javascript APIs (more on that later as well) that tracks browser actions.

# Approach / Technologies
I am aiming to develop everything using MEAN as my main software stack. This will be my very first project utilizing a stack of javascript-based technologies.
